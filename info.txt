------ Building recommenders ------

Two things needed:
- 'fit' function to train our model
- 'recommend' function that uses our model to recommend

## In order to evaluate our recommender we have to define:
- A splitting of the data in URM_train and URM_test
- An evaluation metric
- A function computing the evaluation for each user

## The splitting of the data is very important to ensure your algorithm is evaluated in a
    realistic scenario by using test it has never seen.


## User Relevant vs. Recommended items
# Relevant items are already known in the data set
Relevant item: Has a True/Actual rating >= 3.5
Irrelevant item: Has a True/Actual rating < 3.5

# Recommended items are generated by recommendation algorithm
Recommended item: has a predicted rating >= 3.5
Not recommended item: Has a predicted rating < 3.5
