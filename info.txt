 ------ Building recommenders ------

Two things needed:
- 'fit' function to train our model
- 'recommend' function that uses our model to recommend

# In order to evaluate our recommender we have to define:
- A splitting of the data in URM_train and URM_test
- An evaluation metric
- A functon computing the evaluation for each user

## The splitting of the data is very important to ensure your algorithm is evaluated in a
    realistic scenario by using test it has never seen.
